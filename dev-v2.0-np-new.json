Since non-deterministic Turing machines are special deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What eponymous variation of arithmetic presents a decision problem not evidenced in P?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423236", "answers": [{"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 218}, {"text": "Presburger", "answer_start": 218}, {"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 218}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Despite the Presburger problem, and in view of intractability, what has been done to establish solutions in reasonable periods of time?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423237", "answers": [{"text": "algorithms have been written", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "algorithms have been written", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases", "answer_start": 275}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a problem to which effective algorithms have provided a solution in spite of the intractability associated with the breadth of sizes?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423238", "answers": [{"text": "NP-complete knapsack problem", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "NP-complete knapsack", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "the NP-complete knapsack problem", "answer_start": 394}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How quickly can an algorithm solve an NP-complete knapsack problem?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423239", "answers": [{"text": "in less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 454}, {"text": "less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 457}, {"text": "less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 457}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the example of another problem characterized by large instances that is routinely solved by SAT handlers employing efficient algorithms?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e140042323a", "answers": [{"text": "NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem", "answer_start": 538}, {"text": "NP-complete Boolean satisfiability", "answer_start": 538}, {"text": "the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem", "answer_start": 534}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 218}], "question": "What unknown variation of arithmetic presents a decision problem not evidenced in P?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "algorithms", "answer_start": 275}], "question": "What has not been done to establish solutions in reasonable period of time?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "algorithms", "answer_start": 275}], "question": "What can not solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aeaa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "What intractability means in practice is open to debate.

The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives. Trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives, concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808. Only four years later, the successful twin-cylinder locomotive Salamanca by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway. In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What marine engines were less efficient than steam turbines?", "id": "571154c72419e31400955588", "answers": [{"text": "reciprocating steam engines", "answer_start": 868}, {"text": "reciprocating", "answer_start": 868}, {"text": "reciprocating steam engines", "answer_start": 868}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with diesel engines, what engines have overtaken steam engines for marine propulsion?", "id": "571154c72419e31400955589", "answers": [{"text": "gas turbines", "answer_start": 950}, {"text": "gas turbines", "answer_start": 950}, {"text": "gas turbines", "answer_start": 950}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What engines were used throughout most of the 20th century to propel ships?", "id": "571154c72419e3140095558a", "answers": [{"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 17}, {"text": "steam turbines with reduction gearing", "answer_start": 617}, {"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 17}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What gearing was used on steam turbine marine engines in the 20th century?", "id": "571154c72419e3140095558b", "answers": [{"text": "reduction", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "reduction", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "reduction", "answer_start": 275}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "90", "answer_start": 81}], "question": "What percentage of electricity was made by power plants in the 1990s?", "id": "5ad3f846604f3c001a3ffa5d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "reciprocating steam engines", "answer_start": 868}], "question": "What marine engines were less efficient than gas turbines?", "id": "5ad3f846604f3c001a3ffa5e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "gas turbines", "answer_start": 950}], "question": "What engines, along with diesel engines, have overtaken steam engines for gas propulsion?", "id": "5ad3f846604f3c001a3ffa5f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 17}], "question": "What engines were used throughout most of the 20th century to propel power plants?", "id": "5ad3f846604f3c001a3ffa60", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "reduction", "answer_start": 275}], "question": "What gearing was used on steam turbine engines until the 1990s?", "id": "5ad3f846604f3c001a3ffa61", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines.

The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent.

Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.

Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.

Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey \u2013 some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as Bola spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled \"cydippid\" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33c", "answers": [{"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 98}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the oncorhynchus also called?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33d", "answers": [{"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do beroids typically eat?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33e", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores", "answer_start": 239}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 612}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 612}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the guts of possible predators", "answer_start": 254}], "question": "Where is it hard to identify the remains of salmon in?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "20 times as fast", "answer_start": 460}], "question": "How quickly do shrimp digest ctenophores as compared to other prey?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "good", "answer_start": 543}], "question": "What kind of diet can salmon provide to other predators?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ctenophore", "answer_start": 734}], "question": "What kind of populations can be wiped out temporarily by shrimp?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7ff", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead ends\" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals.

Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Swicthing (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is  DECnet", "id": "57263ea0271a42140099d7c3", "answers": [{"text": "a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation", "answer_start": 10}, {"text": "a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation", "answer_start": 10}, {"text": "suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation", "answer_start": 12}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did DECnet originally do ", "id": "57263ea0271a42140099d7c4", "answers": [{"text": "connect two PDP-11 minicomputers", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "connect two PDP-11 minicomputers", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "connect two PDP-11 minicomputers", "answer_start": 121}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "DEC originally had 3 layers but evolved into how many layers ", "id": "57263ea0271a42140099d7c5", "answers": [{"text": "Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol", "answer_start": 289}, {"text": "seven", "answer_start": 355}, {"text": "seven", "answer_start": 355}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did DECnet phase 2 become ", "id": "57263ea0271a42140099d7c6", "answers": [{"text": "were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux", "answer_start": 517}, {"text": "Linux", "answer_start": 642}, {"text": "open standards", "answer_start": 522}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Digital Equipment Corporation", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "DECnet stands for what?", "id": "5a551230134fea001a0e18cc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a suite of network protocols", "answer_start": 10}], "question": "What is peer to peer?", "id": "5a551230134fea001a0e18cd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol", "answer_start": 353}], "question": "What sort of protocols were developed?

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who wrote about the great pestilence in 1893?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e4", "answers": [{"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Gasquet think the plague was?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e5", "answers": [{"text": "some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague", "answer_start": 132}, {"text": "bubonic plague", "answer_start": 169}, {"text": "ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague", "answer_start": 149}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the second edition of Gasquet's book come out?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e6", "answers": [{"text": "1908", "answer_start": 288}, {"text": "1908", "answer_start": 288}, {"text": "1908", "answer_start": 288}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Gasquet's book blame the plague on?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e7", "answers": [{"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 306}, {"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 306}, {"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 306}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1893", "answer_start": 85}], "question": "When was Francis Aidan Gasquet born?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1893", "answer_start": 85}], "question": "When did the bubonic plague begin in Europe?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Black Death", "answer_start": 250}], "question": "What was the Justinian plague epidemic called?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "700 CE", "answer_start": 510}], "question": "In what year was the Eastern Roman Empire established?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d2470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet, who had written about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\" was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who challenged the plague theory first?", "id": "5726509bdd62a815002e815a", "answers": [{"text": "British bacteriologist J.

Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift{{cite book|isbn=0486617084}, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time.

Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar, or because the rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds, as slip occurs are along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\".

Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis.

I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it.

I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge.

In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.  Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy.  Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.

He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song. Khublai's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects. He instituted the reforms proposed by his Chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy, expanding the circulation of paper money, and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron.  He restored the Imperial Secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged.

Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols.

Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type which tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Sh\u014ds\u014din, in Japan."}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was Zhu Shijie born?", "id": "5728804b4b864d1900164a46", "answers": [{"text": "1249", "answer_start": 110}, {"text": "1249", "answer_start": 110}, {"text": "1249", "answer_start": 110}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Zhu Shijie die?", "id": "5728804b4b864d1900164a47", "answers": [{"text": "1314", "answer_start": 115}, {"text": "1314", "answer_start": 115}, {"text": "1314", "answer_start": 115}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What modern math concept did Zhu Shijie do work similar to?", "id": "5728804b4b864d1900164a48", "answers": [{"text": "matrices", "answer_start": 240}, {"text": "matrices", "answer_start": 240}, {"text": "matrices", "answer_start": 240}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of math was advanced during the Yuan?", "id": "5728804b4b864d1900164a49", "answers": [{"text": "polynomial algebra", "answer_start": 12}, {"text": "polynomial algebra", "answer_start": 12}, {"text": "polynomial algebra", "answer_start": 12}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Zhu publish 'Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns'?", "id": "5728804b4b864d1900164a4a", "answers": [{"text": "1303", "answer_start": 441}, {"text": "1303", "answer_start": 441}, {"text": "1303", "answer_start": 441}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1249", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "When was Zhu Shijie ruler?", "id": "5ad40a41604f3c001a3fff8b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1314", "answer_start": 115}], "question": "When did Zhu Shijie get a new job?", "id": "5ad40a41604f3c001a3fff8c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "matrices", "answer_start": 240}], "question": "What modern math concept did Zhu Shijie do work different from?", "id": "5ad40a41604f3c001a3fff8d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "polynomial algebra", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "What type of math was not advanced during the Yuan?", "id": "5ad40a41604f3c001a3fff8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1303", "answer_start": 441}], "question": "When did Zhu publish 'Jade Mirror of the Five Unknowns'?", "id": "5ad40a41604f3c001a3fff8f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below).kyk"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What co-receptor recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for cell activation?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968b", "answers": [{"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many receptors on a helper T cell must be bound to a MHC:antigen complex in order for the cell to be activated?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968c", "answers": [{"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 417}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 417}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 417}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The receptors on a killer T cell must bind to how many MHC: antigen complexes in order to activate the cell?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968d", "answers": [{"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 580}, {"text": "single", "answer_start": 582}, {"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 580}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Activation of a helper T cell causes it to release what chemicals that influence cell activity?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968e", "answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 776}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 776}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 776}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a ligand on the cell surface that is upregulated after helper T cell activation?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968f", "answers": [{"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1080}, {"text": "CD40", "answer_start": 1080}, {"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1080}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules", "answer_start": 61}], "question": "What antigens do Helper T cells not recognize?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Helper T cells", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What has a stronger association with the MHC:antigen complex than killer T cells?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1f9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 566}], "question": "What are killer T cells dis-activated by?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 776}], "question": "What do helper T cells absorb?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antibody", "answer_start": 1184}], "question": "What do B cells help T cells produce?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules.

This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus.

Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from known to be recognizable by B cells.

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.Painter  & Jeffrey, Political Geography pp. 170\u201375  The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.Painter  & Jeffrey, Political Geography pp. 173\u201376  Colonialism can

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant applicarried an innate force of impetus. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century.

Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \"natural state\" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \"natural state of rest\".

However, if the Horses are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Whwn forces are at right ngles to each other what can they be broken down to?", "id": "57376c50c3c5551400e51ecd", "answers": [{"text": "independent components", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "independent components", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "independent components", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "independent components", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "If a force is pointing horizontally to the northeast, how many forces can you split the force into?", "id": "57376c50c3c5551400e51ece", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the independant components of a vector sum that has been determined by scalar addition of individual vectors?", "id": "57376c50c3c5551400e51ed0", "answers": [{"text": "orthogonal", "answer_start": 497}, {"text": "uniquely determined", "answer_start": 557}, {"text": "orthogonal components", "answer_start": 497}, {"text": "orthogonal components", "answer_start": 497}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can orthogonal forces be when there are three components with two at right angles to each other?", "id": "57376c50c3c5551400e51ed1", "answers": [{"text": "three-dimensional", "answer_start": 1134}, {"text": "three-dimensional", "answer_start": 1134}, {"text": "three-dimensional", "answer_start": 1134}, {"text": "three-dimensional", "answer_start": 1134}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other", "answer_start": 40}], "question": "As well as being subtracted, forces can also what?", "id": "5ad269a7d7d075001a4292e0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}], "question": "A vertical force pointing northeast can be split into how many forces?", "id": "5ad269a7d7d075001a4292e1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "vector addition", "answer_start": 269}], "question": "What yields the non original force?", "id": "5ad269a7d7d075001a4292e2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the third component being at right-angles to the other two", "answer_start": 1157}], "question": "Orthogonal force vectors can can four-dimensional with what?", "id": "5ad269a7d7d075001a4292e3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As well as being added, Horses can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other. A horizontal Horse pointing northeast can therefore be split into two Horses, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component Horses using vector addition yields the original Horse. Resolving Horse vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe Horses than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because Horses acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the Horses is desirable, since that Horse would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal Horse vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed7", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "friction", "answer_start": 154}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is generated between a surface and an object that is being pushed?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed8", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Static friction balances what force when there is no movement of an object on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed9", "answers": [{"text": "applied", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied", "answer_start": 119}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What makes static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51eda", "answers": [{"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 119}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a situation where the object does not move", "answer_start": 64}], "question": "Pulling on an object on a frictional surface can result in what?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a429318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pushing against an object on a frictional surface", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "When will an object move because the applied force is opposed by static friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a429319", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to applied friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to static friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.

For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction.

This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal Horse being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.
